# Diabetic-prediction
Using machine learning approach we are predicting whether a patient is diabetic or not using SVM algorithm.

The dataset used is the PIMA Indian Diabetes dataset. The prediction is based on glucose level, number of pregnancies, blood pressure, insulin, BMI, age of a person, etc. We have split the dataset into training set and test set.
The model has been trained using the SVM algorithm. The packages that are included are numpy, pandas, and sklearn. The accuracy of the model is 78%. The model helps in identifying individuals who are at risk of developing diabetes in the future.
